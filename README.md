# IN-TO-HealthAccess
This is the final project of SOC602: Ethnoracial Disparities in Health. 
This project investigated varying South Asian immigrant (percentage of Indian, Sri Lankan, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi immigrants by census tract) spatial access to healthcare in Scarborough, Ontario using a spatial lag regression model. In the analysis, socioeconomic variables (median household income, percentage of population with a Bachelorâ€™s degree or higher, percentage of economic immigrants, and percentage of family immigrants by census tract) were controlled.
